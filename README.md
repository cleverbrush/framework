This repository contains utility libraries used by [Cleverbrush Online Vector Editor](https://cleverbrush.com).

All of these packages are Open-Source and free to use.

Libraries are written in TypeScript and distributed as ES6 modules. You can use them with any bundler or transpiler.

All libraries are covered with unit tests, if you going to create a pull request, please make sure that your changes are covered with tests and doesn't break existing ones. We use [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) as a test runner.

All libraries are located under `libs` directory. Each library has its own `README.md` file with detailed description and usage examples. Apart from that there is a [documentation website](https://docs.cleverbrush.com/) which is generated by [TypeDoc](https://typedoc.org/). So if you add a new feature or fix a bug, please update the documentation as well, usually it's just a matter of editing JS Doc comments.
